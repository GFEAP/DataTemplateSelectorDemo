# DataTemplateSelectorDemo
Demonstrates DataTemplateSelector
In Xaml we can use _type-driven_ views by mapping a __view__ to a ___data type___.
The UI is then able to insert the desired DataTemplate e.g. a _UserControl_ into the VisualTree 
of the current view based on the data-type it is bound to.

The tool that use to implement such behavior is the DataTemplateSelector
